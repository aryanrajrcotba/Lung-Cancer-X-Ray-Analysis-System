# 🫁 Lung Cancer X-Ray Analysis System

> **AI-Powered IoT Medical Imaging Analysis**

Welcome to the **Lung Cancer X-Ray Analysis System**! This application is a cutting-edge research simulation tool designed to demonstrate the power of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in medical diagnostics. 🚀

## ✨ What is this?

This is a comprehensive React-based dashboard that simulates the end-to-end process of analyzing chest X-Rays for lung cancer detection. It mimics a real-world scenario where medical images are:
1.  **Uploaded** manually or via batch folders. 📂
2.  **Pre-processed** to enhance image quality using advanced techniques. 🎨
3.  **Transmitted** via simulated IoT protocols to a cloud server. ☁️
4.  **Analyzed** by a suite of state-of-the-art Deep Learning models. 🧠
5.  **Visualized** with beautiful, interactive charts for research comparison. 📊

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **🖼️ Smart Upload**: Support for both single X-Ray images and bulk folder uploads for batch processing.
*   **⚡ Real-time Simulation**: Watch the **IoT Status** change as data "connects," "transmits," and "processes."
*   **🤖 Multi-Model Analysis**: We simulate results from **over 30+ top-tier AI models** including:
    *   *ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet, DenseNet*
    *   *Vision Transformers (ViT, Swin)*
    *   *Specialized Medical Models (CheXNet, DeepChest)*
*   **📈 Rich Visualizations**:
    *   **Confidence Comparison Bars**: See which models are most sure.
    *   **Accuracy vs. Parameters**: Scatter plots for research insights.
    *   **Radar Charts**: Performance metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
    *   **Pie Charts**: Distribution of Benign vs. Malignant predictions.
*   **🏆 Best Model Recommendation**: The system automatically highlights the highest-performing model for the specific image.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React + Vite ⚡
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for that modern, clean look) 💅
*   **Icons**: Lucide React 💠
*   **Charts**: Recharts 📉
